/*
 * A magic square of order n is an arrangement of the numbers from 1 to n^2 
 * in an n by n matrix with each number occurring exactly once so that each row, 
 * each column and each main diagonal has the same sum. The n should be an odd 
 * number. In the middle cell of the top row, fill number 1.Then go to above 
 * row and right column, and fill following number 2. If itâ€™s out of boundary, 
 * go to the opposite row or column. If the next cell is already occupied, go 
 * to the cell below this cell and fill following number. An example 
 * of 5*5 grid is like this for the first 9 numbers:
 * 0 0 1 8 0
 * 0 5 7 0 0
 * 4 6 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 0 3
 * 0 0 0 2 9
